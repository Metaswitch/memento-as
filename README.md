Memento
=======

Memento is an Application Server responsible for providing network-based call lists. It records details of all calls made or received by a subscriber so that a list of recent calls can be displayed on the subscriber's devices.

This repository holds the Memento code that's responsible for processing SIP call traffic. [Memento](https://github.com/Metaswitch/memento) holds the code that's responsible for presenting a Ut-like interface to UEs to allow them to download the call list for their subscriber.

This code is built as a [Sprout plugin](https://github.com/Metaswitch/sprout/blob/dev/docs/Plugins.md).
